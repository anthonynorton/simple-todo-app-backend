Traits
  Name, If the group decides the trait applies then you lower the difficulty by one


Health: {
  encumbrance: {
    if your encumbrance is greater than or equal to your hitpoints then you are weary (weary is checked). Typically measured in "stone" (ie. 14lbs)
  },
  weary: {
    boolean,
    if true increases difficulty by one
  },
  hitpoints: {
    for PCs is 5 + constitution score (constitution is a skill)
    If you get to 1 hitpoint your difficulty for all checks increases by one. If you go to zero you are incompacitated/uncoscious/etc (the storyteller decides)
    Below 0 and you are dead.
    Health can be tracked on a 0.1 level (tenths of a hitpoint) Usually depicted by a dimond shape divided into tenths
    score: <Number>

MORE NOTES:
How many experience points does a normal player start out with? 30

How are traits determined, when making up a character? Based on Culture, and Calling. You may also chose a trait base on background.


My Thoughts On Making It:

Perhaps I should make it possible to attach notes to everything ('Add a note' as an option on right click, or something)

Bonds: Should be able to be positive or negative (ie. you love your battle buddy, and hate your father's murder, or abusive uncle)
